    "The classic way for propagation of uncertainty is through linear approximation of error propagation theory. We start with the mathematical function that relates the physical quantities and estimate the contribution of their variations by means of partial derivatives (the rate of variation) of each of these primary quantities. The linearity of the mathematical function in the vicinity of the obtained value and the statistical correlations between these quantities are also taken into consideration in the propagation of uncertainty.   \n",
    "If the measurand $f$ is defined in terms of the variables $x, y, z, ...$ by a general expression $f(x, y, z, ...)$, a first order approximation of the propagation of uncertainty ignoring correlations bettwen these variables is given by the well known formula:\n",

    "Where $ \\partial f/\\partial i $ is the first partial derivative of $ f $ with respect to variable $ i $ and $ \\sigma_i $ is the uncertainty of the measurement of the variable $ i $ (one standard deviation).  \n",

    "## Using a software to calculate uncertainty\n",

    "It is essential that any result of a measurement is accompanied by the estimate of its uncertainty as above, this way we can better understand the value of the measure and how reliable it is. However, it is unlikely that anyone will repeat these calculations in the day-to-day work (although there are tables with partial derivatives for the most common expressions). Therefore, it is useful a software that can perform these calculations (at least for checking the results manually obtained).
